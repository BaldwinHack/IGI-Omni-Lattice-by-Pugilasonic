IGI Omni-Lattice by Pugilasonic

Invisibility. Reinvented. Conceptual. Open. Futuristic.

IGI Omni-Lattice is a speculative research project by Pugilasonic, exploring the theoretical design of omnidirectional invisibility technology using metamaterials, adaptive optics, nanostructure lattices, and AI-driven environmental sensing.

This repository provides concepts, blueprints, theoretical frameworks, and design notes for what a next-generation invisibility system could look like if major scientific breakthroughs aligned.
It is not a functional weapon, device, or classified system — it is an open, public, creative research exploration.

🔷 Project Vision

IGI Omni-Lattice imagines a future where cloaking technologies are:
	•	Wearable
	•	Omnidirectional
	•	Weather-resistant
	•	Adaptive to speed and movement
	•	Lightweight and portable
	•	Powered by advanced metamaterial lattices

The concept explores how light, infrared, and ultraviolet wavelengths might theoretically be bent or redirected around a subject using a responsive “lattice” of intelligent optical nodes.
