# IGI Omni-Lattice — $35,000 Advanced Optical Cloaking Rig
### Non-classified • Experimental • Educational • Speculative Optics Research

This is the ultra-high-end version of the Omni-Lattice. At this tier, the build integrates
micro-fabricated metamaterial arrays, active adaptive optics, and a full edge-blending AI
pipeline. Designed for experimental labs, film effects groups, and research spaces.

# 🔧 CORE TECHNOLOGY (HIGH-END TIER)

## 1. Micro-fabricated Metamaterial Lattice (5–8 micron precision)
- Outsourced to professional micro-fabrication shops  
- 10× finer than makerspace SLA  
- Dramatically reduces shimmer & distortion  
- Allows nearly seamless light-redirection

## 2. Multi-Layer Optical Stack (Premium)
- Lenticular → Phase-corrective → Nanodiffusion → AR-coated layer system
- Commercial-grade anti-reflection coating (≤ 0.7% reflectance)
- Phase-corrective nanofilm eliminates “bend artifacts”

## 3. Full Adaptive Optics System (Cinematic Level)
- 24–32 micro-cameras embedded around perimeter
- Real-time AI edge correction
- Jetson AGX Orin or FPGA cluster
- Predictive blending engine reduces human-motion detection

## 4. HDR Micro-Display Backfill System
- Micro-OLEDs or micro-LEDs
- Auto-corrects shadows and high-contrast regions
- Makes background appear continuous even with low ambient light

## 5. Precision-Alignment Frame (Lab-Grade)
- Carbon fiber composite + aerospace tolerances
- Micron alignment rails
- Anti-shock isolation mounts

## 6. Environmental Compensation
- Auto-brightness adjustment
- Anti-glare compensation
- Temperature-stable optics (prevents warping)

# 🎯 PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS

## 📏 1. Close Range (1 foot / 30 cm)
- **Not fully invisible**
- HOWEVER:
  - Edge shimmer extremely reduced
  - Lattice distortion almost imperceptible
  - Looks like a “mirage window,” not a panel

### Detectability: **Medium**  
You can still tell something is there up close.

---

## 📏 2. Medium Range (2–3 feet)
- **Very strong concealment**
- Background appears almost continuous
- Motion detection reduced by adaptive optics
- Human outline difficult to see head-on

### Detectability: **Low**

---

## 📏 3. Ideal Range (4–7 feet)
- **Cinematic-grade directional invisibility**
- To a casual observer:
  - Person appears to vanish
  - Only slight rippling on rapid movement
- Cameras (especially phone cameras):  
  - Often show near-complete disappearance

### Detectability: **Very Low**

---

## 📏 4. Extended Range (8–15 feet)
- **Exceptionally convincing invisibility**
- On video: looks like true cloaking
- In person:  
  - Nearly seamless background  
  - Person effectively “not there”

### Detectability: **Extremely Low**

---

# 🔦 Lighting Performance

### Best:
- Bright indoor studio lighting  
- Outdoor daylight  
- Environments with even illumination  

### Good:
- Normal indoor lighting  
- Mild shadows  

### Challenging:
- Very dark areas (micro-displays compensate but not perfectly)  
- Harsh spotlighting

# 🧪 SUMMARY

- **$6k** build → effective camouflage at 8–15 ft  
- **$15k** build → near invisible at 3–5 ft  
- **$35k** build → *cinematic near-invisibility* at 4–7 ft  
- Still directional (not 360º)  
- Still physical optical redirection (not sci-fi cloaking)  
- 100% non-classified & suitable for experimental/educational R&D
