## Omni-Lattice — Practical Visibility Performance Estimate

### 📏 Close-Range Performance
- From **1 foot (30 cm)** away:
  - You will **not** be fully invisible.
  - The viewer will see:
    - Background distortion
    - A predicted "shimmer" around edges
    - Light-bending but not full disappearance

- Appearance is similar to:
  - A heat-wave mirage
  - A glass panel that redirects light

### 👀 Mid-Range (3–6 feet)
- Background blends more smoothly
- Figure becomes hard to distinguish
- Viewer perceives:
  - “Something is there” but unclear form
  - Significant camouflage-like effect

### 👤 Long-Range (8–15 feet)
- **Highly effective directional invisibility**
- Person behind panel can appear:
  - Faded
  - Distorted
  - Nearly absent when viewed head-on

### 🔦 Lighting Conditions
- Best: Outdoor daylight or bright indoor lighting
- Worst: Dim conditions (not enough background light)

### 📸 Cameras vs. Human Eyes
- Cameras (phone or security) are easier to fool
- Human eyes detect shimmer more easily
- Excellent for:
  - Filming
  - Stage tricks
  - Sci-fi effects
  - Experimental research

### 🧪 Summary
- **Not** full invisibility at 1 ft
- **Highly convincing camouflage** at 8–15 ft
- **Directional**, not 360º cloaking
- Achievable with consumer-grade optics & makerspace tools
- Educational, non-classified metamaterial demonstration
