## IGI Omni-Lattice — $15,000 High-Performance Build (Advanced Makerspace / Lab)

This version of the Omni-Lattice takes a major leap in performance using higher-grade optics, microdisplays, adaptive correction, and finer lattice precision. It remains a non-classified, educational metamaterials project.

# 🔧 Core Hardware Upgrades

### 1. **High-precision micro-lattice (10–20 micron)**
- Printed on industrial SLA/DLP printers or outsourced
- Much lower optical distortion vs. hobby-level 3D print

### 2. **Next-gen lenticular + phase-layer hybrid**
- Multi-layer structure:
  - Lenticular layer
  - Fresnel focus layer
  - Nanodiffusion film
  - Anti-reflective coating
- Smooths light-redirection dramatically

### 3. **Real adaptive correction (major upgrade)**
- 8–12 micro-cameras embedded along edges
- FPGA or Jetson Nano for real-time background blending
- Removes shimmer and eliminates edge artifacts

### 4. **Microdisplay backfill enhancement**
- Tiny, low-power micro-OLEDs help patch lighting inconsistencies
- Used only when background contrast is high

### 5. **Rigid but lightweight frame**
- Carbon fiber or magnesium alloy
- Allows fine tuning and optical alignment

# 🎯 What This Version Can Achieve

### 🟢 **Close Range (1–2 ft)**
- Still *detectable*, but MAJOR improvements:
  - Far less shimmer
  - Blending is smoother
  - Edges much less obvious
- Looks like:
  - A glass panel with mild distortion
  - A “mirage wall”

### 🟡 **Moderate Range (3–5 ft)**
- **Very strong directional invisibility**
- From head-on:
  - Human outline nearly gone
  - Viewer sees mostly corrected background
  - Motion still detectable but subtle

### 🟠 **Extended Range (6–10 ft)**
- **Extremely convincing invisibility**
- Human figure often disappears completely
- Works on:
  - Human eyes  
  - Phone cameras  
  - Security cameras  
  - DSLR footage  

### 🔦 Lighting Sensitivity
- Performs well in:
  - Daylight
  - Studio lighting
  - Bright indoor environments  
- Adaptive system compensates for:
  - Shadows  
  - Dark clothing  
  - Motion contrast
